The following CSS code snippet has a potential issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This might not override the parent's color */
}
```

The `div p` selector attempts to set the color of paragraphs within divs to green. However, depending on the context and other CSS rules, this might not override the color set for the `p` element (red).  This is because the specificity of the `p` selector is higher than the `div p` selector.
