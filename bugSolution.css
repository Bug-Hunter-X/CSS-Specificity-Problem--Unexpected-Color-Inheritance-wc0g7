The issue can be solved by increasing the specificity of the selector targeting paragraphs within divs or by using the `!important` flag (though use of `!important` is generally discouraged).

Here are two solutions:

**Solution 1 (Increased Specificity):**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div > p {
  color: green; /* Increased Specificity using the child combinator */
}
```

**Solution 2 (Using `!important` - Not Recommended):**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green !important; /* Using !important (Use cautiously!) */
}
```

Solution 1 is the preferred method as it addresses the root cause of the problem without relying on `!important`.
